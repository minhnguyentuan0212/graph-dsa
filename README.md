# Undirected Graph Data Structure

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of undirected graph data structures. It explores various graph types, representations, properties, and algorithms for traversing and manipulating graph data effectively.

## Features
- Implementation of an undirected graph data structure.
- Exploration of graph representations including adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.
- Analysis of graph properties and traversal methods including BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).
- Implementation of algorithms for solving common graph problems such as finding Euler paths/cycles, Hamiltonian paths/cycles, shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall), and minimum spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim).
- Investigation of advanced graph problems including transportation, cut vertices, stable marriage problem, and more.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Traversal**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra's, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Kruskal's, Prim's
- **Special Algorithms**: Euler paths/cycles (Fleury's Algorithm), Hamiltonian paths/cycles
- **Problem Solving**: Solutions to specific graph-related problems such as transportation, stable marriage, and network delay time.
